    # @param raw_response [Boolean] Whether the return value should be the raw JSON response or parsed into RSpotify models

    # Create a playlist-style listening experience based on seed artists, tracks and genres
    #
    # @note Up to 5 seed values may be provided in any combination of seed_artists, seed_tracks and seed_genres.
    #
    # @param limit        [Integer]       The target size of the list of recommended tracks. For seeds with unusually small pools or when highly restrictive filtering is applied, it may be impossible to generate the requested number of recommended tracks. Debugging information for such cases is available in the response. Default: 20. Minimum: 1. Maximum: 100.
    # @param seed_artists [Array<String>] A list of Spotify IDs for seed artists.
    # @param seed_genres  [Array<String>] A list of any genres in the set of {https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/get-recommendations/#available-genre-seeds available genre seeds}.
    # @param seed_tracks  [Array<String>] A list of Spotify IDs for seed tracks.
    # @param market       [String]        Optional. An {https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2  ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code}. Provide this parameter if you want to apply Track Relinking. Because min_*, max_* and target_* are applied to pools before relinking, the generated results may not precisely match the filters applied. Original, non-relinked tracks are available via the linked_from attribute of the relinked track response.
    # @param raw_response [Boolean] Whether the return value should be the raw JSON response or parsed into RSpotify models
    # @option options     [Float]         :min_acousticness Hard floor on the confidence measure from 0.0 to 1.0 of whether the track is acoustic. 1.0 represents high confidence the track is acoustic.

    # @option options     [Float]         :min_danceability Hard floor on how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity. A value of 0.0 is least danceable and 1.0 is most danceable.

    # @option options     [Float]         :min_energy Hard floor on energy which is a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. For example, death metal has high energy, while a Bach prelude scores low on the scale.

    # @option options     [Float]         :min_instrumentalness Hard floor on prediction of whether a track contains no vocals. "Ooh" and "aah" sounds are treated as instrumental in this context.

    # @option options     [Float]         :min_liveness Hard floor on liveness, which detects the presence of an audience in the recording.

    # @option options     [Integer]       :min_mode Hard floor on the modality (major or minor) of a track, the type of scale from which its melodic content is derived. Major is represented by 1 and minor is 0.

    # @option options     [Integer]       :min_popularity Hard floor on the popularity of the track. The value will be between 0 and 100, with 100 being the most popular. The popularity is calculated by algorithm and is based, in the most part, on the total number of plays the track has had and how recent those plays are.
    # @option options     [Integer]       :max_popularity Hard ceiling on the popularity of the track. The value will be between 0 and 100, with 100 being the most popular. The popularity is calculated by algorithm and is based, in the most part, on the total number of plays the track has had and how recent those plays are.

The popularity is calculated by algorithm and is based, in the most part, on the total number of plays the track has had and how recent those plays are.
    # @option options     [Float]         :min_speechiness Hard floor on speechiness which detects the presence of spoken words in a track. The more exclusively speech-like the recording (e.g. talk show, audio book, poetry), the closer to 1.0 the attribute value. Values above 0.66 describe tracks that are probably made entirely of spoken words. Values between 0.33 and 0.66 describe tracks that may contain both music and speech, either in sections or layered, including such cases as rap music. Values below 0.33 most likely represent music and other non-speech-like tracks.
