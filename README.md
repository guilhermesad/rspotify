This is a ruby wrapper for the [new Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api), released in June 17, 2014.

## Features

* [Full documentation](http://rdoc.info/github/guilhermesad/rspotify/master/frames)
* Full API Endpoint coverage
* OAuth and other authorization flows

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'rspotify'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install rspotify

## Usage

Directly access Spotify public data such as albums, tracks, artists and users:

```ruby
require 'rspotify'

artists = RSpotify::Artist.search('Arctic Monkeys')

arctic_monkeys = artists.first
arctic_monkeys.popularity      #=> 74
arctic_monkeys.genres          #=> ["Alternative Pop/Rock", "Indie", ...]
arctic_monkeys.top_tracks(:US) #=> (Track array)

albums = arctic_monkeys.albums
albums.first.name #=> "AM"

am = albums.first
am.release_date      #=> "2013-09-10"
am.images            #=> (Image array)
am.available_markets #=> ["AR", "BO", "BR", ...]

tracks = am.tracks
tracks.first.name #=> "Do I Wanna Know?"

do_i_wanna_know = tracks.first
do_i_wanna_know.duration_ms  #=> 272386
do_i_wanna_know.track_number #=> 1
do_i_wanna_know.preview_url  #=> "https://p.scdn.co/mp3-preview/<id>"

# You can search within other types too
albums = RSpotify::Album.search('The Wall')
tracks = RSpotify::Track.search('Thriller')
```

Find by id:

```ruby
arctic_monkeys = RSpotify::Artist.find('7Ln80lUS6He07XvHI8qqHH')
arctic_monkeys.related_artists #=> (Artist array)

am = RSpotify::Album.find('41vPD50kQ7JeamkxQW7Vuy')
am.album_type #=> "single"

do_i_wanna_know = RSpotify::Track.find('2UzMpPKPhbcC8RbsmuURAZ')
do_i_wanna_know.album #=> (Album object)

wizzler = RSpotify::User.find('wizzler')
wizzler.uri #=> "spotify:user:wizzler"

# Or find several objects at once:

ids = %w(2UzMpPKPhbcC8RbsmuURAZ 7Jzsc04YpkRwB1zeyM39wE)

my_tracks = RSpotify::Track.find(ids)
my_tracks.size #=> 2
```

Some endpoints require authentication to be accessed, such as playlists. You can easily get your credentials [here](https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications).

Then just copy and paste them like so:

```ruby
RSpotify.authenticate("<your_client_id>", "<your_client_secret>")

# Now you can access any public playlist and much more

playlist = RSpotify::Playlist.find('wizzler', '00wHcTN0zQiun4xri9pmvX')
playlist.name               #=> "Movie Soundtrack Masterpieces"
playlist.description        #=> "Iconic soundtracks featured..."
playlist.followers['total'] #=> 13
playlist.tracks             #=> (Track array)

my_user = RSpotify::User.find("my_user")
my_playlists = my_user.playlists #=> (Playlist array)
```

RSpotify focuses on objects behaviour so you can forget the API and worry about your tracks, artists and so on.

It is possible to write things like `playlist.tracks.sort_by(&:popularity).last.album` without having to think what API calls must be done. RSpotify fills the gaps for you.

Check the [documentation](http://rdoc.info/github/guilhermesad/rspotify/master/frames) for all attributes and methods of albums, artists, etc.

## Rails + OAuth

You may want your application to access an user's Spotify account.

For instance, suppose you want your app to create playlists for the user based on their taste, or to add a feature that syncs the user playlists' with some external app.

If so, add the following to your application (Remember to [get your credentials](https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications))

```ruby
# config/application.rb

RSpotify::authenticate("<your_client_id>", "<your_client_secret>")
```

```ruby
# config/initializers/omniauth.rb

Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do
  provider :spotify, "<your_client_id>", "<your_client_secret>", scope: 'user-read-email playlist-modify-public user-library-read user-library-modify'
end
```

You should replace the scope values for the ones your own app will require from the user. You can see the list of available scopes in [here](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/using-scopes).

Next, make a link so the user can log in with his Spotify account:

```erb
<%= link_to 'Sign in with Spotify', '/auth/spotify' %>
```

And create a route to receive the callback:

```ruby
# config/routes.rb

get '/auth/spotify/callback', to: 'users#spotify'
```

Remember you need to white-list this callback URI with Spotify. You can do this by adding it to the Redirect URIs list in your [application page](https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications). An example of Redirect URI would be http://localhost:3000/auth/spotify/callback.

Finally, create a new RSpotify User with the response received:

```ruby
class UsersController < ApplicationController
  def spotify
    spotify_user = RSpotify::User.new(request.env['omniauth.auth'])
    # Now you can access user's private data, create playlists and much more

    # Access private data
    spotify_user.country #=> "US"
    spotify_user.email   #=> "example@email.com"

    # Create playlist in user's Spotify account
    playlist = spotify_user.create_playlist!('my-awesome-playlist')

    # Add tracks to a playlist in user's Spotify account
    tracks = RSpotify::Track.search('Know')
    playlist.add_tracks!(tracks)
    playlist.tracks.first.name #=> "Somebody That I Used To Know"

    # Access and modify user's music library
    spotify_user.save_tracks!(tracks)
    spotify_user.saved_tracks.size #=> 20
    spotify_user.remove_tracks!(tracks)

    # Check doc for more
  end
end
```

The user's access token is automatically refreshed by RSpotify when needed. This is specially useful if you persist the user data to a database: this way the user only needs to log in to Spotify once when using your application.

RSpotify provides a way to facilitate persistence:

```ruby
hash = spotify_user.to_hash
# hash containing all user attributes, including access tokens

# Use the hash to persist the data the way you prefer...

# Then recover the Spotify user whenever you like
spotify_user = RSpotify::User.new(hash)
spotify_user.create_playlist!('my_awesome_playlist') # automatically refreshes token
```

## Notes

If you'd like to use OAuth outside rails, have a look at the [Sinatra Example](/guilhermesad/rspotify/examples/siantra-example.rb) for a use case for consuming the [Web API Authorization Code Flow](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/authorization-guide/#authorization_code_flow) directly. You can pass the response to RSpotify::User.from_credentials just as well, and from there easily create playlists and more for your user.
